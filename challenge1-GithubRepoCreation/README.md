# Coding Club Challenge 1: GitHub Repo Setup & “Ready to Code” Page

This repository contains my submission for Challenge 1 of the Coding Club Challenge Series.

## Duration

2 weeks

## Goal

Set up a public GitHub repository, practice local Git workflows, and build a simple styled HTML page using collaborative team tools.

---

## What I Did

- Created a public repository named: `challenge-tonyDavis`
- Added a folder: `challenge1-GithubRepoCreation`
- Created and styled `index.html` to display a welcome message
- Used GitHub Issues to track progress
- Created a feature branch and opened a pull request
- Wrote this `README.md` to explain the project and setup steps

## Project Structure

Choose your level — start with Easy and level up if you're ready!

🟢 Easy
Bare minimum requirements — great for total beginners.

 Create a public repo in the codingUnited org:
challenge-yourName

 Add a folder:
challenge1-GithubRepoCreation

 Create an index.html that displays:
"Ready to Code!"

 Commit and push to GitHub

🟡 Medium
For those ready to get more hands-on with Git and HTML.

✅ Everything from Easy
 Clone the repo locally using git clone
 Make changes using a local code editor (like VS Code)
 Use a separate feature branch for your changes
 Open a pull request to merge into main
🔴 Hard
Introduces basic HTML styling and team workflow concepts.

✅ Everything from Medium
 Add basic CSS to style your index.html (external or inline)
 Use GitHub Issues to track your progress (create one for this challenge)
 Include a README.md explaining your project and setup steps
🟣 Leet
Advanced and curious members can stretch further into tooling and hosting.

✅ Everything from Hard
 Enable GitHub Pages to publish the HTML file
 Add a .gitignore file and explain its purpose
 Set up a simple GitHub Action that runs on push
(even just a linter or echo)
 Bonus: Add a favicon or use a custom font

The .gitignore file prevents unnecessary or sensitive files (like system files, logs, secrets, or dependency folders) from being committed to version control. This keeps the repository clean and secure.
